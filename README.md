## Production

The application is available at https://uptv.herokuapp.com/.

Sign up to start subscribing to TV shows and receive email alerts for the latest episodes!

## Install

Create a `.env` file at the project root with your credentials (for details, see [Settings](#settings)):

```dotenv
TMDB_API_KEY=...
SENGRID_API_KEY=...
```

Depending on how you want to run UpTV, some extra steps may be necessary ‚Äî see below.

## Quickstart

### Using Docker

This project requires Python 3.7+. If you don't have it installed on your machine, we provide a Docker Compose setup. You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

The Docker Compose setup runs UpTV in production mode: hot-reloading is disabled, a PostgreSQL database is used instead of SQLite, and the alerts worker will start.

To run UpTV using Docker, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Using local Python 3.7+

If you have Python 3.7+, you can run UpTV without Docker. However, a few more installation steps are required:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```

You can now start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8000.

By default, the alerts worker won't start in development. To activate it, use:

```bash
export ALERTS_ACTIVE=1  # or set it in .env
python manage.py runserver --noreload
```

> **Note** : using this method, the alerts worker will run in sandbox mode and emails won't be delivered. To force email delivery, use the `ALERTS_FORCE_EMAIL` setting (see below).

To use the Gunicorn production server instead, use:

```bash
gunicorn uptv.wsgi -c uptv.gunicorn
```

## Settings

The following settings are available and can be defined in your `.env` file:

- `TMDB_API_KEY` (no default): used to query the TheMovieDatabase (TMDB) API, which provides our data. If you don't have an API key, you can create a (free) TMDB account. Refer to the [Getting Started guide](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (no default): used to send alerts via email using SendGrid. For details, see [django-sendgrid-v5](https://github.com/sklarsa/django-sendgrid-v5). 
- `ALERTS_ACTIVE` (default: `False`): whether to start the alerts worker upon server startup.
- `ALERTS_FORCE_EMAIL` (default: `False`): whether to force the alerts worker to deliver emails in development. If `False`, emails will not be delivered (useful for local testing). This setting has no effect in production mode.
- `ALERTS_RUN_TIME` (default: `08:00:00`): `hh:mm:ss` string representing the run time of the alerts worker.

## Features

Here's what UpTV can do for you:

- Search for TV shows you'd be interested in.
- **Mark a show as a favorite**.
- Manage your list of favorite shows.
- **Look up episodes and read their summaries**.
- **Receive daily alerts for new episodes**.

It also features:

- An intuitive design and minimal graphic charter.
- Account signup and profile management.
- Smart search capabilities.
- Email alerts.
- Display of last and next episode for each show.
- Count of followers.
- Sign up for an account.

## Techniques

Here are the techniques we used to build UpTV:

- **Object Oriented Programming** (OOP) in Python: API client, API parsers, API data representation, notifiers‚Ä¶
- **Threads**: alerts worker running in the background.
- **Consuming a REST API**: the TheMovieDB API.
- **Providing REST API endpoints**: `POST /api/subscribe/:show_id`, `DELETE /api/subscribe/:show_id`.
- **Client-server architecture**.
- Web application development using Django.
- HTML/CSS/JS web development.
- Integration with third-party libraries.
- Definition, usage and management of a SQL database (SQLite, Postgres)
- OOP in JavaScript (e.g. `series/static/series/counter.js`).
- Deployment to production using Heroku.
- Containerization using Docker.
- Collaborative development using GitHub, Pull Requests and Trello.
- Automated testing of critical features.
- CI/CD using TravisCI (test execution and automated deployments on `git push`).
- Sending emails via a third-party web service (SendGrid).

## Contributing
