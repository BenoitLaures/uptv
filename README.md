## Install

Install dependencies:

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

Start development server:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Configuring email delivery of alerts

Alerts about new episodes are delivered via email.

In production, email delivery is powered by [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com). Credentials are associated to the `uptv` Heroku application and not disclosed here, obviously.

It is also possible to use SendGrid in development. You will need to acquire a valid SendGrid API key (free hobby accounts are available) and to provide it through the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable.

> Note that in `DEBUG` mode, emails will purposefully NOT be sent unless the `SENDGRID_SANDBOX_MODE_IN_DEBUG` is set to `False`. For more information, see [django-sendgrid-v5](https://github.com/sklarsa/django-sendgrid-v5).

If SendGrid email is not configured, emails will not be sent but alerts will still be logged to the console.

### Conventions

These are conventions we recommend to apply throughout the project. They are being updated as we agree upon new conventions.
